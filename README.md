# Overview Navigation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nathanielsimard/overview-navigation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nathanielsimard/overview-navigation)

This extension aims to make Gnome Shell easier to navigate using only the keyboard. It is inspired by the vim plugins of Firefox and Chrome.

## Usage

In the overview, the user can press `space` and letters are going to pop in the corner of every window. To focus a particular window, you have to press its letters one after the other.
